# Pipelines for C#

A library for implementing programs as Pipeline objects. Inspired by Arlo Belshee's talk, [Refactoring to Async](https://www.ustream.tv/recorded/114862163).

## Pipelines

## Suggested Plugin
 
[Graphviz (dot) language support for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaompinto.vscode-graphviz) by Jo√£o Pinto is great. CTRL-SHIFT-V to preview a `.dot` file as a rendered graph.
