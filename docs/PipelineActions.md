## Joining pipes

When you have two inputs that are needed for the next piece of functionality, you need a `JoinedPipe`. 

`JoinedPipe`s produce a `Tuple` of two inputs.

Note: If you are using `JoinedPipe` you need to call `Verify()` with the join.

<!-- snippet: joined_pipeline -->
```cs
var input1 = new InputPipe<long>("value1");
var input2 = new InputPipe<long>("value2");
var join = input1.JoinTo(input2);
```
