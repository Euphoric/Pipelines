# Refactoring To Async Tutorial

## Prep

* Download the [sample exercise](https://github.com/ondjuric/PipelinesExercise) 
* Install the VsCode and the plugin [Graphviz (dot) language support for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaompinto.vscode-graphviz) by Jo√£o Pinto 
CTRL-SHIFT-V to preview a `.dot` file as a rendered graph.



## Step by Step

## Notes

 1. All pipeline setup code occurs at the top of the method.  
 2. Then the approvals call  
 3. Then the sending thru the pipeline

### 1. Call the method in question from a test

Simply call the method you wish to refactor from a test.
Don't think of this as a traditonal unit test. Think of it more as a specialized `main()` method

### 2. Take the 1st thing to move to async and create an `InputPipe` of it's parameters directly above it.

``` cs
 var startingPointInput = new InputPipe<InputType>("InputName");
 ```
 
 ### 3. Place a ApprovalTests to get insight into the pipeline.
 
 Place this right in the middle of the production code you want to refactor. It is a temporary step.
 
 ``` cs 
  PipelineApprovals.Verify(startingPointInput);
 ```
 
 With a DotReporter (on the test)
 
 ``` cs 
 [UseReporter(typeof(DotReporter))]
 ```

### 4. Inspect result in VsCode

### 5. Add a process as a delegate

If the code isn't in a method, extract it to one first

``` cs
 var methodCallPipe = startingPoint.Process(TheMethodCall)
```

Do this above the approvals.Verify(). Run it again for feedback

### 6. Add a collector, and send input in

``` cs
 var methodCallCollector = methodCallPipe.Collect();
 startingPoint.Send(firstParameter);
 var variable = methodCallCollector.SingleResult;
```

### 7. Repeat
