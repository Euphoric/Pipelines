## Step by Step

## Notes

 1. All pipeline setup code occurs at the top of the method.
 2. Then the approvals call
 3. Then the sending through the pipeline

### Template 

```cs
// Set up Pipeline
// ApprovalPipeline
// Send thru pipeline
// Original code
```
### 1. Call the method in question from a test

Simply call the method you wish to refactor from a test.
Don't think of this as a traditional unit test. Think of it more as a specialized `main()` method

### 2. Take the 1st thing to move to async and create an `InputPipe` of it's parameters directly above it.

``` cs
var startingPointInput = new InputPipe<InputType>("InputName");
```

### 3. Place a ApprovalTests to get insight into the pipeline.

Place this right in the middle of the production code you want to refactor. It is a temporary step.

``` cs
PipelineApprovals.Verify(startingPointInput);
```

With a DotReporter (on the test)

``` cs
[UseReporter(typeof(DotReporter))]
```

### 4. Inspect result in VsCode

### 5. Add a process as a delegate

If the code isn't in a method, extract it to one first

``` cs
 var methodCallPipe = startingPoint.Process(TheMethodCall)
```

Do this above the `approvals.Verify()`. Run it again for feedback

### 6. Add a collector, and send input in

``` cs
 var methodCallCollector = methodCallPipe.Collect();
 startingPoint.Send(firstParameter);
 var variable = methodCallCollector.SingleResult;
```

### 7. Process and Collect the next step in the pipeline

### 8. (optional) Delete dead code

### 9. Goto step 7

## Handling multiple parameters

Everything is a single parameter. To use multiple, you'll have to join them into tuples. If this is requires new inputs, you'll need multiple input pipes
